Hello! Thank you for taking the time to review my TIW application. I love learning and building cool things, so I'm quite excited to have the opportunity to utilize (and hopefully become more involved with) the tools at TIW.

***A brief note***: this website has been an on-and-off project for me, and it is not complete. There are many projects that will not be on this site by the time you read this. Some projects I have on display may not have full writeups attached; I note when that is the case on each project page. Despite all that, I think you'll still be impressed by what I have so far. I'd also be happy to talk about my projects not displayed on this site, of course.

Without further ado, my collection of projects can be found [here](/projects).
