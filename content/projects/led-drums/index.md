***I have not gotten around to properly explaining the full details of this project. However, I still wish to show it off, so this page will be more of a picture gallery and less of a story or explanation.***

This project was born out of my love for music and my affinity for things that light up. By placing LED light strips inside each of my drums and hooking them up to a controller, I can create synchronized light shows to augment my drumming. Furthermore, since the controller I'm using supports sACN, Art-Net, DMX, and DDP, it can integrate with industry-standard light show software without too much hassle.

Finally, here's a small video of my putting the whole rig to use. I'm not certain how well the loudness level's on the video clip are adjusted, so I'd suggest making sure your system's volume isn't up too high. I particularly like this video because it shows how the system can integrate with other systems like my LED top hat.
