# Under Construction

This project is a continuation of my [LED Tophat](/projects/led-tophat) project.

After one round of tirelessly CADing curved geometry for my LED Tophat, I was rewarded with quite possibly the coolest hat at the 2023 Odyssey of the Mind World Finals (read the project post for a few funny stories). When world finals ended, I carefully disassembled the hat for air transit. After returning home, I realized that I had no use for the hat. That raised the question: how can I repurpose the hardware for daily use? My answer: a cool desktop/wall-mountable LED box that could display what ever I wanted!
